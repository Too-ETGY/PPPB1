    <string name="news_title">How ‘The Fantastic Four: First Steps’ Pays Tribute to Jack Kirby</string>
    <string name="news_content">
        The new Marvel Studios film is directly inspired by Jack “King” Kirby, the legendary artist and creator responsible for some of the most iconic characters in the world.\n
        Kirby’s signature art style first brought Reed Richards, Sue Storm, Johnny Storm, and Benjamin Grimm to life in the pages of Marvel Comics, and director Matt Shakman wanted The Fantastic Four: First Steps to be a “love letter” to his legacy.\n
        Early in the Fantastic Four development process, Shakman and production designer Kasra Farahani decided on a style they called “When Kirby Meets Kubrick,” melding Kirby’s signature art with the sci-fi storytelling of Stanley Kubrick’s 1968 classic 2001: A Space Odyssey.\n
        The result is a trippy, retro-futuristic world that looks like it sprang straight from the pages of Kirby’s comics — from the gorgeous architecture of the Baxter Building to the sleek lines of the Fantasticar.\n
        Feige notes that Kirby has influenced every Marvel Studios film to date, calling him “one of the greatest storytellers and artists of the 20th century.”\n
        Kirby also famously grew up on New York’s Lower East Side, and his upbringing helped inspire some of the comics’ most iconic locations, like Yancy Street.\n
        One of Shakman’s favorite shots in the film recreates Kirby’s cover for FANTASTIC FOUR (1961) #1, the first-ever appearance of Marvel’s First Family.\n
        The end-credits also conclude with a quote from Kirby himself: “If you look at my characters, you will find me. No matter what kind of character you create or assume, a little of yourself must remain there.”
